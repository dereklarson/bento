## Quickstart

Dependencies: Python 3.7

Bento 0.1.1 is on the test PyPI repository, and can be installed with:

`pip3 install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ bento-dash==0.1.1`

To make sure everything is working, try building the demo app:

`python3 -m bento.dashboards.demo`

If there are no warnings, you should see `bento_app.py` and `assets/`.
You can now run:
