Introduction
============
Bento is a templating engine built on `Plotly Dash <https://plotly.com/dash/>`_. It lets you
write a high-level description of your desired interactive dashboard and generates
the application code for you. By providing a set of common building blocks and
abstracting away some of the more complicated aspects, it aims to flatten the learning
curve of dashboarding!

For some inspiration, check out some sample Bento apps in `this gallery <https://github.com/dereklarson/bento_gallery>`_.

To get a sense of what Plotly Dash can do, visit `their app gallery <https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/Portal/>`_.

Bento follows a few principles in its goal of improving user productivity:
 * Allow users a selection of ready-made building blocks called **banks**
 * Automatically handle component interactivity infrastructure
 * Provide a simple theming and layout experience
