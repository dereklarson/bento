Introduction
============

Bento is a templating engine built on [Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/). It lets you
write a high-level description of your desired interactive dashboard and generates
the application code for you. By providing a set of reusable building blocks and
abstracting away some of the more complicated aspects, it aims to flatten the learning
curve of dashboarding!
